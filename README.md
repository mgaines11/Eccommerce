        -   Django
            # Highlights code & gives me code suggestions
        -   SQLite
            # Allows access for me to have a look into the database


create venv (virtual enviornment file to install individual packages away from the main computer & the main version of python on this machine

manage.py file - allows access to django admin functionality

core file - the core application itself

store file - to build up model and Database & so on


understanding tables 
    - The columns make up the feilds & structure of the table
    - The Columns will hold or rows which represent individual records in our table


Tables SQLite
- Django automatically builds an ID an auto incremented number having the primary key associated to all of the different feilds
